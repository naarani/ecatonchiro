# Ecantonchiro - "Hundred-Handed Ones" - designed for the developers

(agentless) automation engine

This is actually in alpha stage, if you're not a developer it's not still ready for you.

At this stage there are already working scripts to provision server from digitalocean,
run commands to create user and run shell:
works from windows or macos or linux (unzip file and run) having an ssh linux server as destination

This is a Java project, so you don't need specific instruction to install it on each platform ;-P
(the first alpha release is available)


## Background
I run remote deployment installation test of kargo and kubeadm.
All is done provisioning centos 7.x servers for each job on digitalocean (I run tests on bare metal too)

Actually I do it running a java application from windows, macos or linux:
I need 'em to test kargo and kubeadm releases, before evaluate to use 'em in production.

The requirements of kargo are some pre-flight activities and ansible with specific version, while kubeadm needs only some preflight checks.

I've decided to put all in a new application where the install start with yaml configuration file like ansible:
this is Ecantonchiro.



## Overview
The application is in pre alpha stage:

(2017/05/17) remote install ansible (why not!), working examples, first alpha release 

(2017/05/05) actually only provisiong server from DigitalOcean is working with yaml configurations files, as described in the wiki 

[Roadmap](https://github.com/naarani/ecantonchiro/wiki/roadmap)

the actual features are to run remote scripted commands from ssh like:

1. provisioning servers from digitalocean

1. yum

1. shell

... now working on templates reusing jinja2 templates on java with jinjava

P.S. 
We are already working on web GUI, but all will still work with a simple CLI



## Build jar

to build the project run:

    $ git clone https://github.com/naarani/ecantonchiro.git
    $ cd ecantonchiro
    $ gradle --task jarWithLib

it will create in the _build/libs/_ directory the main jar runnable with all the needed jars in the directory _lib_
